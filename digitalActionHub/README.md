# Squarespace
This is a record of the code injection I did for the Digital Action Hub website. 
This website is also the project for my CS 195 Web Site Development Practicum class.
I was in a team of 3. My main responsibility is header, footer, social media features, and parts that would be in-common among all website pages (logo, typography, etc).

The website was done on Squarespace.
Code injection was used because the client would like:
1) Social media button without providing password information. This means that our team cannot use the build-in widgets in Squarespace. We also must find social media images that does not pixelized in different screen size.
2) Floating bar for the social media. This means that we must go into the header and css injection.
3) Contact information. This means that client information would be exposed online. JS injection was utilized to prevent bots from search engine.
